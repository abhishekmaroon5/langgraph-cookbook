# LangGraph Tutorial Series

Welcome to the comprehensive LangGraph tutorial series! This collection of tutorials will guide you through building sophisticated, stateful applications with LangGraph, from basic concepts to advanced patterns.

## What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It extends the LangChain ecosystem by providing a framework for creating complex workflows that can handle state management, conditional logic, and multi-agent interactions.

# Core dependencies
pip install -U langgraph langchain-community langchain-anthropic

# Additional tools
pip install tavily-python pandas openai

# Optional: For advanced examples
pip install sqlite3 requests numpy
```

### Environment Setup

Set up your API keys securely:

```python
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    """Securely set environment variables."""
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

# Required API keys
_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")  # For Claude models
_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")     # For GPT models (alternative)
_set_env("TAVILY_API_KEY")     # For web search (optional)
```

### Your First LangGraph Application

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

# Define the state structure
class ChatState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, "The messages in the conversation"]
    user_name: Annotated[str, "User's name"]
    conversation_count: Annotated[int, "Number of conversations"]

# Create the LLM
llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229")

# Define the chat node
def chat_node(state: ChatState) -> ChatState:
    """Process user message and generate response."""
    messages = state["messages"]
    
    # Add conversation context
    context_message = f"User: {state['user_name']}, Conversation #{state['conversation_count']}"
    
    # Generate response
    response = llm.invoke([HumanMessage(content=context_message)] + messages)
    
    return {
        **state,
        "messages": messages + [response],
        "conversation_count": state["conversation_count"] + 1
    }

# Create the graph
workflow = StateGraph(ChatState)

# Add nodes and edges
workflow.add_node("chat", chat_node)
workflow.set_entry_point("chat")
workflow.add_edge("chat", END)

# Compile the graph
app = workflow.compile()

# Use the application
result = app.invoke({
    "messages": [HumanMessage(content="Hello!")],
    "user_name": "Alice",
    "conversation_count": 1
})

print(f"Response: {result['messages'][-1].content}")
print(f"Conversation count: {result['conversation_count']}")
```

### Try It Yourself!

**Interactive Exercise**: Modify the above code to:
1. Add a greeting based on the time of day
2. Track the user's mood
3. Provide personalized responses

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```python
from datetime import datetime

def enhanced_chat_node(state: ChatState) -> ChatState:
    """Enhanced chat node with time-based greetings and mood tracking."""
    messages = state["messages"]
    current_time = datetime.now().hour
    
    # Time-based greeting
    if 5 <= current_time < 12:
        greeting = "Good morning"
    elif 12 <= current_time < 17:
        greeting = "Good afternoon"
    else:
        greeting = "Good evening"
    
    # Enhanced context
    context_message = f"{greeting} {state['user_name']}! This is conversation #{state['conversation_count']}"
    
    response = llm.invoke([HumanMessage(content=context_message)] + messages)
    
    return {
        **state,
        "messages": messages + [response],
        "conversation_count": state["conversation_count"] + 1
    }
