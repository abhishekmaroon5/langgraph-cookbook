# LangGraph Tutorial Series

Welcome to the comprehensive LangGraph tutorial series! This collection of tutorials will guide you through building sophisticated, stateful applications with LangGraph, from basic concepts to advanced patterns.

## What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It extends the LangChain ecosystem by providing a framework for creating complex workflows that can handle state management, conditional logic, and multi-agent interactions.

## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial series is designed to take you from beginner to advanced LangGraph developer. Each tutorial builds upon the previous ones, providing hands-on examples and practical applications.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorials, ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install -U langgraph langchain-community langchain-anthropic tavily-python pandas openai
```

### Environment Setup

Set up your API keys:

```python
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
_set_env("TAVILY_API_KEY")
```

### Your First LangGraph Application

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

# Define the state
class ChatState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, "The messages in the conversation"]

# Create the LLM
llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229")

# Define the chat node
def chat_node(state: ChatState) -> ChatState:
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = llm.invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": messages + [response]}

# Create the graph
workflow = StateGraph(ChatState)

# Add nodes and edges
workflow.add_node("chat", chat_node)
workflow.set_entry_point("chat")
workflow.add_edge("chat", END)

# Compile the graph
app = workflow.compile()

# Use the application
result = app.invoke({
    "messages": [HumanMessage(content="Hello!")]
})
print(result["messages"][-1].content)
```

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial series, you will be able to:

- **Understand LangGraph fundamentals** and how they differ from traditional LangChain
- **Build stateful applications** that maintain context across interactions
- **Create custom tools** and integrate them into your workflows
- **Implement conditional logic** for dynamic routing and decision-making
- **Design multi-agent systems** with specialized capabilities
- **Handle advanced patterns** like interrupts, checkpoints, and error recovery
- **Integrate with external systems** and APIs
- **Build production-ready applications** with proper error handling and monitoring

## Key Concepts Covered

### State Management
- TypedDict for state definition
- State persistence and validation
- Context sharing between nodes

### Tools and Integration
- Custom tool creation
- External API integration
- Database operations

### Conditional Logic
- Dynamic routing based on content
- Time-based and priority-based routing
- Multi-agent handoffs

### Multi-Agent Systems

### Advanced Patterns
- Interrupts and human-in-the-loop
- Checkpoints and state persistence
- Error handling and circuit breakers
- Performance optimization

## Example Applications

Throughout the tutorials, you'll build several practical applications:

1. **Simple Chat Bot** - Basic stateful conversation
2. **Customer Support Bot** - Tool integration and routing
3. **Travel Booking System** - Multi-agent coordination
4. **Content Creation System** - Specialized workflow
5. **Production-Ready Application** - Advanced patterns and error handling

## Best Practices

The tutorials emphasize these best practices:

- **Modular Design** - Create reusable, focused components
